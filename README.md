## Fall 2025 Research Onboarding
By: Baljinder H.

### Contents of the Repo

This repo contains the Imitation Learning implimentations for Diffusion, Gaussian Ablation, Mean Squared Error with EMA, and Autoregressive Discretization. The code uploaded here are from my local repo where I ran the code and verified the outputs, but I did clean up the code as I had a lot of repetitive print statements and logging metrics.

### Acknowledgements

I did consult a LLM for this onboarding, I used it as more of a tool to learn and did not throw entire files into it, rather I watched videos and read implimentations online, and when I would get stuck or would get an error, or would get a very unstable reward, I would throw a specific function or chunk of code in Claude and ask it to help my diagnose and learn what I can improve upon and why. Ill mention this more in the result paper(should be sent EOD September8th 2025)
